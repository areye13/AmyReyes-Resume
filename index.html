        <p class="lead mb-4"<p>Hi, My name is Amy and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. I plan to obtain  my Bachelor's degree in Theatre, Film and Digital Productions with a concentration in Film Production. As well as, I plan to either minor or double major in Media and Cultural Studies at some point during my undergraduate.
        As well as, I plan to either minor or double major in Media and Cultural Studies at some point during my undergrad.
        <p class="lead mb-4" <p>With my degree, I want to pursue a career in the film industry by producing and working behind the scenes in movies, television shows, or web series. The idea of working with a team and creating a creative project together has always interested me. Although the entertainment industry is extremely competitive, I would one day love the opportunity to work alongside production companies such as A24, Paramount, Warner Bros, or Netflix. A career in productions consists of helping oversee and coordinate the prograss of developing a film whether that means directing, script supervising, or being involved in the financial aspects of a project. The production aspect of filmaking is challenging, because one has to learn how to work well others and remain organized.
        I do believe here at UCR I will be able to learn from my professors and peers on the aspects of the filmmaking path that could help educate myself on my career.
        <p class="lead mb-4" <p>By minoring or double majoring in Media and Cultural Studies, I will be able to gain background knowledge over ethnicity, culture, and gender in current media. Both of these majors are fascinating to me due to how they are similar they are to one and another since they involve working with media. As an individual who heavily thrives in creative and artistic environments, I believe these majors allow me to continue to do that. Not to mention, I love that films give an audience a temporary escape from harsh reality.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-4" <p>In regards to my current undergraduate path, when I accepted admission to UCR I learned the many opportunites they offered in their theatre, film, and digital production department. Throughout the academic school year, the department offers students local, on and off-campus opportunies where TFDP students are able to gain hands on experience in theatre or film. In the first fall quarter of my freshman year, I was able to participate in a student organized short film with 
        R'Shorts as a sound operator.This experience allowed me to further expand my knowledge of working on a film set and the different jobs that are needed to create any type of video project. UCR also informs students of outside internships in companies such as Disney where one can build their resume and connections with others in the industry.
        <p class="lead mb-4" <p>With that being said, as of right now my plans include finishing my Bachelor's degree in both Theatre, Film, and Digital Productions and Media and Culture Studies in four years. During the next years, I plan to further my hands-on experience and interact with others who are majoring in film also to work on future projects together. There is no doubt that I am content with my decisions to continue to pursue a career in the arts.
